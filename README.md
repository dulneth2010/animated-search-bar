# Animated Search Bar

The code creates an animated search bar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a stylish design that includes a shadow effect, magnifier and microphone icons, and a transparent input field.

The most notable feature of this animated search bar is the animation effect that is triggered when the magnifier icon is clicked. The search bar container toggles the "active" class, which changes the width of the container to 50 pixels and hides the input field and microphone icons. This creates a smooth animation effect that looks visually appealing.

Overall, this project shows how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used to create visually appealing and functional user interfaces. The code is well-written and easy to understand, making it a good example for developers who want to learn how to create similar designs.

## New Things I Learned

I learned about the toggle() method, which is a JavaScript method used to add or remove a class from an HTML element. When you call toggle() on an element, it adds the specified class to the element if it doesn't already have it, and removes the class if it does.

In the context of the animated search bar project, toggle() is used to add and remove the "active" class from the search bar container element. When I click on the magnifier icon, the "active" class is added to the container element, which triggers the animation effect that changes the width of the container and hides the input field and microphone icons. Clicking the magnifier icon again removes the "active" class, which triggers the animation effect that restores the search bar to its original state. 

I found this method to be really useful, and I can see how it could be applied to other web development projects in the future.
